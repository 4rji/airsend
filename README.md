# AirSend

AirSend is a lightweight command-line tool developed to transfer files and exchange messages directly between machines with customized IP and port settings, overcoming limitations found in similar tools like Wormhole.

I created AirSend out of the necessity for flexibility that other tools like Wormhole lackedâ€”particularly the ability to customize IP addresses and ports. AirSend addresses these gaps by supporting multiple file transfers, direct peer-to-peer connections, customizable ports, and the option to store files and messages on a relay server (C2).

## Key Features

- Customize IP addresses and ports
- Send and receive multiple files
- Direct peer-to-peer connections
- Relay server support (C2)

## Usage

### Server Mode
Start a server to manage file transfers and message relays:
```bash
sudo airsend -s <host> <port>
```

### File Transfer
**Send Files:**
```bash
airsend -f <host> <port> <file1> <file2>
```

**Receive Files:**
```bash
airsend -r <host> <port> <code>
```

### Messaging
**Send Messages:**
```bash
airsend -m <host> <port>
```

**Receive Messages:**
```bash
airsend -mr <code> <host> <port>
```

### Direct Transfer Mode
**Direct Send:**
```bash
airsend -d <target-host> [port] <file>
```

**Direct Receive:**
```bash
airsend -ds <listen-host> <port>
```
